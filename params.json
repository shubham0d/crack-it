{"name":"Crack-it","tagline":"A toolkit to crack hash value which works on dictionary attack..Supported most common hash algorithm.Also able to create hash and crack salted hash.","body":"Crack any hash value with famous algorithm available\r\n(md5,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha384,sha512)\r\nIt is also supports salted hash value with\r\nmd5,sha256,sha512 as algorithm.Also able to create\r\nhash value from work with supported algorithm\r\n(md5,blowfish,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha512)\r\n\r\nIt Works on some common packages available in linux\r\nor if not installed then will require some minimal packages to\r\nwork.the cracking is based on simple dictionary attack in which\r\npassword will match by creating hash value of every dictionary\r\nword and then matching it\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture updates:-\r\n==============\r\n\r\nWill soon comes with brute force attack option.\r\nwill also come with browser as gui.\r\nfile handling will be done by python rather then by linux shell cmd.\r\nmultiple threading yet to be implemented.\r\ndirect command line option will be present to make it more handy.\r\nand many more..\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall crack-it:\r\n================\r\njust run install.sh with cmd:-\r\n$bash install.sh\r\n\r\n(internet connection may required if all dependency does'nt satisfy)\r\n\r\nTo start:-\r\n========\r\nrun $crackit from your terminal\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
