Crack-it v1.0|
=============|

Crack any hash value with famous algorithm available                                                                  
(md5,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha384,sha512)                                                                                
It is also supports salted hash value with                                                                            
md5,sha256,sha512 as algorithm.Also able to create                                                                    
hash value from work with supported algorithm                                                                         
(md5,blowfish,sha1,sha224,sha256,sha512)

It Works on some common packages available in linux
or if not installed then will require some minimal packages to
work.the cracking is based on simple dictionary attack in which
password will match by creating hash value of every dictionary
word and then matching it


Future updates:-
==============

Will soon comes with brute force attack option.                                                                       
will also come with browser as gui.                                                                                 
file handling will be done by python rather then by linux shell cmd.                                                  
multiple threading yet to be implemented.                                                                             
direct command line option will be present to make it more handy.                                                   
and many more..


Install crack-it:
================
just run install.sh with cmd:-

(internet connection may required if all dependency does'nt satisfy)
